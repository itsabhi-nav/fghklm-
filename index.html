          <p>Thank God! my dream project got a shape at last. I have pleasure to have a long association with teachers and
            taughts and have deeply experienced their tastes ans aptitudes. So, I managed to establish this institution at
            my own cost to impart good education through english medium. Since reading writing and speaking english has
            become the order of the day now, I founded this english medium school based on CBSE syllabus on 18th feb 2005.
            I am obliged to Shri Sundardev Singh, retired director, Higher Education, Bihar Govt, Who inaugrated this
            academy. I am also thankful to Shri Birendra Kumar Mishra, retired Principal and many others who lent their
            hands with timely suggestions in shaping this school. Now, this school has turned a pioneer academy in this
            subdivision. I owe much more to parents and guardians of the area who showed faith in me and admitted their
            children in this institution.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This academy is 18 years old. Beside subject knowledge we also pay attention on extra curricular activities
            so that child can grow in overall direction. I have qualified and experienced teachers to bear the bulk of
            teaching Special attention is paid to the all round development of the child-both physical and mental. The
            whole world has turned a village now. Students should be aware of day to day happenings and should have
            capacity to express themselves before any one whether native or alien. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I feel, there is much more to be done to make it a milestone in the field of education. I need your
            co-operation and suggestions. I wish  bright future and a prosperous life to all my students. </p>
